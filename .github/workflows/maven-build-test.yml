# This workflow builds, tests, and analyzes the project.
# It runs on pushes and pull requests to the main branch,
# and on pushes to feature branches (only for code changes).
# Tests are executed against LTS JDK versions: 8, 11, 17, 21.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Build once with JDK 21 (generates JAR)
# 2. Run tests on all LTS JDK versions using the compiled artifact
